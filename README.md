Learn how to analyze data using Python.
Data Analysis libraries: Pandas, Numpy and Scipy libraries to work with a sample dataset. Pandas, an open-source library, use it to load, manipulate, analyze, and visualize cool datasets. Scikit-learn, another open-source library, some of its machine learning algorithms to build smart models and make cool predictions.


1) Importing Datasets
2) Cleaning the Data
3) Data frame manipulation
4) Summarizing the Data
5) Building machine learning Regression models
6) Building data pipelines
